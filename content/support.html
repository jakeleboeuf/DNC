		<p>Laugh Your Way to a Better Marriage’s founder, Mark Gungor, is one of the most sought-after speakers on marriage and family in the country. Each year thousands of couples attend his Laugh Your Way to a Better Marriage® seminars. Mark’s candid and comedic approach uses unforgettable illustrations and the power of laughter to teach proven principles that are guaranteed to strengthen any marriage.</p>
		<p><em>“I love to inspire people’s lives with truth and humor. There are a lot of performers that make people laugh, and there are a lot of speakers who give solid principles for living. I want to do both,” Mark says. His take on marriage issues is refreshingly free of both churchy and psychological lingo. “Our secular culture over-romanticizes marriage and our Christian culture over-spiritualizes it. The reality is that relationships between men and women are very down to earth,” Mark comments. “Laugh Your Way to a Better Marriage® is about helping couples get it right, get along, have fun, and achieve a successful marriage.”</em></p>	    	<h3>The Focus on the Family "Date Night Challenge Simulcast":</h3>

    <h2><a href="#">Love &amp; Respect</a></h2>
	<div>
    	<p>We (Love &amp; Respect Organization) believe love best motivates a woman and respect most powerfully motivates a man. Research reveals that during marital conflict a husband most often reacts when feeling disrespected and a wife reacts when feeling unloved.  We asked 7,000 people this question: when you are in a conflict with your spouse or significant other, do you feel unloved or disrespected?  83% of the men said "disrespected."  72% of the women said, "unloved."  Though we all need love and respect equally, the felt need differs during conflict.
		<p>We conduct conferences and provide resources to the married, divorced, separated, dating and single. Men and women will learn how to resolve conflict and how to motivate each other by meeting each other's need . Even those who feel hopeless in their relationships will gain understanding on how to handle an indifferent or unresponsive partner.
		<p>With the help of Love & Respect resources, couples everywhere are experiencing understanding, forgiveness, reconciliation, change, and hope.
