<P>Register your corporation to be part of the Corporate Date Night Challenge:</P>
<P>Businesses all over Palm Beach are signing up to help enrich the relationships of their employees.  By participating in the Corporate Date Night Challenge, businesses are agreeing to release their employees off of work at 4pm for the 5 Tuesday Nights of the Palm Beach Date Night Challenge launching Tuesday January 17th and concluding on Tuesday February 14th. Dates Nights will be from 6-9pm at over 60 participating locations throughout Palm Beach County.</P>
<P><b>Date Nights</b> are good for business and good for relationships. "For every $1 spent on employees there is up to a $6.85 return on investment."  Business is driven by profit. Employees in healthy relationships can increase that profit, while employees in failing relationships decrease that profit. Inasmuch as your company works to increase productivity, efficiency, and profitability, it's smart to make relational wellness your business. This is an excellent way that companies are choosing to incentivize their employees in the New Year by adding value back to their most valuable relationship! So do something good for your business and participate in the "Corporate Date Night Challenge".</P>
