<p>Research shows that couples who devote time to each other at least once a week are more likely to have higher levels of communication, sexual satisfaction and commitment. These results are fueling a dating movement nationwide that challenges couples to go on 4 dates in 4 weeks.</p>
<p>In the Portland/Vancouver Metro Areas, the month of August is “Date Night Month.”  During which, celebrations of relationships will materialize spontaneously in the form of flash mobs, Date Night Events and special promotions designed to help everyone: young, old, married and single; “Get their date on!”</p>
<p>Local dining, lodging, entertainment and retail businesses are joining the initiative with special offers.</p>
<p>This city-wide challenge will be launched during “First Thursday,” August 2nd, in Portland’s Pearl District and will conclude Saturday night, August 25th, with “Fight Night.” An event designed to address relationship issues with a wildly funny and engaging twist...The speakers, married relationship therapists, Drs. Les and Leslie Parrott, pretend to “Duke-it-out.”</p>
